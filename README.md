# cookiecutter-napari-plugin

Minimal [Cookiecutter] template for authoring [napari] plugins that help
you to write better programs.

> This template requires [Cookiecutter 1.4.0 "Shortbread"][Shortbread] or
> higher

## Getting Started

Install [Cookiecutter] and generate a new napari plugin project:

```no-highlight
$ pip install cookiecutter
$ cookiecutter https://github.com/napari/cookiecutter-napari-plugin
```

Cookiecutter prompts you for information regarding your plugin:

```no-highlight
full_name [Napari Developer]: Ramon y Cajal
email [yourname@example.com]: ramon@cajal.es
github_username [githubuser]: neuronz52
plugin_name [foobar]: growth-cone-finder
module_name [growth_cone_finder]: growth_cone_finder
short_description [A simple plugin to use with napari]:
version [0.1.0]:
minimum_napari_version [None]:
Select docs_tool:
1 - mkdocs
2 - sphinx
3 - none
Choose from 1, 2, 3 [1]: 1
Select license:
1 - BSD-3
2 - MIT
3 - Mozilla Public License 2.0
4 - Apache Software License 2.0
5 - GNU LGPL v3.0

Choose from 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) [1]:
INFO:post_gen_project:Moving files for mkdocs.
```

There you go - you just created a minimal napari plugin:

```no-highlight
napari-growth-cone-finder/
├── LICENSE
├── README.rst
├── docs
│   └── index.md
├── mkdocs.yml
├── napari_growth_cone_finder.py
├── setup.py
├── tests
│   └── test_growth_cone_finder.py
└── tox.ini
```

## Features

- Test suite running [tox] and [napari] that makes sure your plugin is working
  as expected
- Working example code for a fixture, a cli option, as well as a napari.ini
  option
- Comprehensive `README.rst` file that contains useful information about your
  plugin
- Continuous integration configuration for [Travis CI] and [AppVeyor]
- Optional documentation with either [Sphinx] or [MkDocs]
- Choose from several licenses, including [BSD-3], [MIT], [MPL v2.0], [Apache v2.0], [GNU GPL
  v3.0], or [GNU LGPL v3.0]

## Requirements to Submit a Plugin

If you plan on submitting your plugin to the [napari organization] you need
to meet the following requirements:

- PyPI presence with a setup.py that contains a license, napari-
  prefixed, version number, authors, short and long description.
- a tox.ini for running tests using tox.
- a README describing how to use the plugin and on which platforms
  it runs.
- a LICENSE file or equivalent containing the licensing information,
  with matching info in setup.py.
